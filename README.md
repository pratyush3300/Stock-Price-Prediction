Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning :-
This project predicts stock prices using machine learning techniques, leveraging historical data from NVIDIA and Tata Global. The model analyzes trends, identifies patterns, and makes future price predictions based on past stock performance.

Features:
âœ… Data collection from NVIDIA & Tata Global stock datasets
âœ… Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering, normalization)
âœ… Machine learning models for price prediction (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM)
âœ… Visualization of stock trends and future price projections
âœ… Performance evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores

Results:
ðŸ“ˆ The model was trained on NVIDIA and Tata Global stock price data, offering insights into market trends and predicting future prices with reasonable accuracy.
