# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Model – Tata & Nvidia

This project predicts stock prices using machine learning techniques, leveraging historical data from NVIDIA and Tata Global. The model analyzes trends, identifies patterns, and makes future price predictions based on past stock performance.

## 🧠 Tech Stack & Tools:

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow / Keras
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Datasets:

Historical stock price data of:
- **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** – Indian IT company
- **Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)** – U.S. semiconductor and AI company

Data includes:
- Opening and closing prices
- High, low, and volume
- Date-wise records over several years

> The datasets were sourced particularly from Kaggle.

## 🛠️ Key Features:

- 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 📉 Visualization of trends and patterns
- 🧮 Data preprocessing: scaling, handling nulls, and formatting
- 🤖 Machine Learning model training:
  - Linear Regression
  - LSTM (optional if implemented)
- 📊 Forecasting and performance comparison (actual vs predicted)
- ✅ Performance evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² scores

## 🧩 Challenges Faced:
- Cleaning and formatting real stock data from Tata and Nvidia, including handling missing values and inconsistent dates.
- Preparing time-series sequences correctly for model input, especially for advanced models like LSTM.
- Deciding between simple and complex models and tuning them for better prediction accuracy.
- Visualizing actual vs predicted values clearly and aligning them with the correct timelines.
- Managing tool installations and running the project smoothly within lab environment constraints and deadlines.


## 📈 Result Obtained:
 The model was trained on NVIDIA and Tata Global stock price data, offering insights into market trends and predicting future prices with reasonable accuracy.
